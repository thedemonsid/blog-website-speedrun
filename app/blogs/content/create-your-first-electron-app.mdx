### Prerequisites

Before diving into this blog, ensure you have a solid understanding of the following topics:

- **Web Development Fundamentals**  
- **React Basics**: Familiarity with the basic structure of a React project.  
- **TypeScript** *(optional)*: While not mandatory, it can be helpful.


### What is Electron?

Electron is a **framework for building desktop applications** using web technologies like **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It enables the creation of **cross-platform apps** that work seamlessly(not everytime 😐) on **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux**.

In essence, you are writing simple web code *(HTML CSS and JS)* to build powerful(but quite heavy 😅) desktop applications.

> **Must know**: A simple "Hello World" program in Electron can take up around 180MB of disk space.

> **My Advice**: For a deeper understanding, refer to the official [Electron Documentation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest).

### Why Electron?

Even with its large size compared to traditional methods, Electron stands out because:

- It's **easy to use**, making it accessible for web developers.  
- It has a **supportive and active community** that continuously improves the framework.  
- The learning curve is minimal, as it&apos;s **straightforward and beginner-friendly**.  

### Setting Up the Project (React)

1. Create a vite project
```sh
pnpm create vite
```
Do the following :

![pnpm create vite](/pnpm-create-vite.png)

- Choose the project name you want
- Select React as framework
- Select TypeScript (best practices)  
and then run :
```sh
cd your-project-name
pnpm install
```
