### Prerequisites

Before diving into this blog, ensure you have a solid understanding of the following topics:

- **Web Development Fundamentals**  
- **React Basics**: Familiarity with the basic structure of a React project.  
- **TypeScript** *(optional)*: While not mandatory, it can be helpful.


### What is Electron?

Electron is a **framework for building desktop applications** using web technologies like **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It enables the creation of **cross-platform apps** that work seamlessly(not everytime 😐) on **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux**.

In essence, you are writing simple web code *(HTML CSS and JS)* to build powerful(but quite heavy 😅) desktop applications.

> **Must know**: A simple "Hello World" program in Electron can take up around 180MB of disk space.

> **My Advice**: For a deeper understanding, refer to the official [Electron Documentation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest).

### Why Electron?

Even with its large size compared to traditional methods, Electron stands out because:

- It's **easy to use**, making it accessible for web developers.  
- It has a **supportive and active community** that continuously improves the framework.  
- The learning curve is minimal, as it&apos;s **straightforward and beginner-friendly**.  

### Setting Up the Project (React)

1. Create a vite project
```sh
npm create vite@latest
```
Do the following :

![npm create vite](/npm-create-vite.png)

- Choose the project name you want
- Select React as framework
- Select TypeScript (best practices)  
and then run :
```sh
cd your-project-name
npm install
```
> **Optional**: Initialize a Git repository to track your changes and collaborate effectively if needed.

Try Running the react app you would see:
![npm dev](/vite-project-look.png)

2. Create a new folder named `web` inside the `src` directory. 
   This folder will house the web-specific part of your project.

3. Copy all the files from the `src` directory into the `web` folder. 
   This separation ensures that the web and Electron parts of the project remain organized and modular.

4. Update the `<script>` tag's `src` attribute in your `index.html` file to point to the correct path.  
   This ensures that your application loads the appropriate scripts for the Electron environment.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/vite.svg" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Vite + React + TS</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/web/main.tsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
Now run your react app via `npm run dev` and it will work as intended :)

### Adding Electron

#### Step 1: Create a Folder for Electron
Create a folder named `electron` inside the `src` directory.  
This folder will contain all the Electron-specific code, keeping it separate from the web code.

#### Step 2: Install Electron
Install Electron as a dev dependency by running the following command:

```sh
npm install electron --save-dev
```

1. Create a folder named `electron` inside the `src` directory. 
2. Install Electron
```sh
npm install electron --save-dev
```
3. Create a `tsconfig.json` inside `src` as we will have different `typescript` setup for electron app.
```json
// src/electron/tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "target": "ESNext",
    "module": "NodeNext",
    "outDir": "../../dist-electron",
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "types": ["../../types"]
  }
}
```
4. In the `tsconfig.app.json` exclude `src/electron`
```json
// tsconfig.app.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "tsBuildInfoFile": "./node_modules/.tmp/tsconfig.app.tsbuildinfo",
    "target": "ES2020",
    "useDefineForClassFields": true,
    "lib": ["ES2020", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"],
    "module": "ESNext",
    "skipLibCheck": true,

    /* Bundler mode */
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "allowImportingTsExtensions": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "moduleDetection": "force",
    "noEmit": true,
    "jsx": "react-jsx",

    /* Linting */
    "strict": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "noUncheckedSideEffectImports": true
  },
  "include": ["src"],
  "exclude": ["src/electron"]
}
```
5. Create `main.ts` inside the `electron` folder.Write any console you like for example

```tsx
console.log("This is the_demon_sid from electron")
```
6. In `package.json` add 

```json
"main" : "dist/electron/main.js"
...
"scripts":{
  ...
  "dev:electron" : "electron ."
 }
```
this will run our main.js in dist/electron folder with elctron and you will receive a log on terminal.
