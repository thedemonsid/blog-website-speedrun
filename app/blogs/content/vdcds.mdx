In this blog we'll try to make a component named navbar work.
Navbar is a component that is used to navigate through the website.

```javascript
import { Navbar } from "@react-spectrum/navbar";
return <Navbar>Label</Navbar>;
```

<Image alt="navbar" src="/images/logo.jpeg" width={500} height={500} />
<MyComponent />
